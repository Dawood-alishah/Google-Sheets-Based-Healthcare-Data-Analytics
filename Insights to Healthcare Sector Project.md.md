## **Shift Analysis for Physicians and Hospitals**

This repository contains the insights derived from **physician shift data** across various hospitals, originally provided as screenshots. The data was analyzed, organized, and visualized using Google Sheets to deliver actionable insights on hospital performance and physician engagement. 

### **Base Data Provided:**
- The initial data shared by the client consisted of screenshots, which I have included in this repository as `Base Data Shared by Client`.
- These screenshots show shifts provided by each physician at each hospital, broken down month by month.

### **Analyzed Google Sheet:**
The link below directs to the published Google Sheet containing the analyzed data, providing two unique perspectives:

### **Key Insights:**

1. **Hospital-Wise Shift Performance**:
   - The shifts have been segregated and organized by hospital, then visually represented through graphs.
   - These graphs track shift volume across all months, identifying high-performing hospitals.
   - This allows easy identification of trends and top hospitals in terms of shift allocation.

2. **Physician-Wise Shift Tracking**:
   - Another sheet in the Google document details shifts for each physician, broken down by month.
   - An **average-based calculation** identifies whether a physician is surpassing the **average shift threshold** or not.
   - **Slicers, Pivots and filters** enable micro-level insights, making it easy to view detailed data by month, hospital, or physician.

### **Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Data Segregation & Organization**: Effective restructuring of data from raw screenshots into organized tables for easy analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphs and visual tools to represent shifts across hospitals and physicians.
- **Automation & Calculations**: Use of formulas to calculate averages and other critical metrics for detailed insights.
- **Slicers & Filters**: For interactive data exploration at a micro-level, allowing users to focus on specific details when needed.

### **How I Used This Data:**
By converting the raw screenshot data into structured Google Sheets, I was able to:
- **Identify key trends** across hospitals and physicians.
- **Present data visually**, making insights more accessible and actionable for decision-makers.
- **Create interactive filters**, allowing stakeholders to deep-dive into specific data points as required.

### **How to Use This Repository:**
- **Base Data Shared by Client**: Contains the raw screenshots initially provided by the client.
- **Link to Analyzed Google Sheet Data**: Directs to the analyzed data with charts, graphs, and filters for easy insights.
